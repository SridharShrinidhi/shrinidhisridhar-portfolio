  text1: Something about me? Let's see..
        I have always loved learning new things and am very curious about new products, ideas, people, their minds, To design user experiences, currently in the digital world, helps me understand minds and solve amazing problems. A perfect example of the experimental and curious side of me is this website. I have always found the process and reason behind a product more intriguing and understanding from your perspective, helps me learn more. Let's keep learning and growing together! <br>I also would like to tell you that I took a small detour, before I got to where I am, doing what I love, as a Electrical & Electronics Engineer. <br>Ask me about my logo when we meet.
