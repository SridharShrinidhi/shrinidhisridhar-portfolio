meta: Recipe and mealtime prep app for millenials.
heading1: Bluebowl
subHeading1: The app designed created based on weekend conversations with friends, is an effective meal-planning app for single/nuclear families, homes with roommates to make for easy, simple cooking.
process1: The app features scanning of ingredients, to generate recipes based on selected diets/cuisines. People living with roommates can regularly create schedules to take turns at cooking. Voting amongst them helps with identifying the meal of the day. The app also features automatic grocery list creation based on the meal plans and recipes. This also helps with reducing waste by buying groceries required for the week and ensuring they don’t go to waste.
text1: The recipes are also suggested based on the expiry dates of products to ensure zero/negligible waste. Oh, I almost forgot, the app can be used by grocery stores to provide customized groceries to the consumers for a convenient shopping experience. (Please sponsor us!)

heading2: Process
subHeading2: The target audience was identified to be millenials, nuclear families, buddies rooming. Following target audience identification and research on competitors, ideation was the next step. Clean, bold app with an appealing aesthetic that helps users navigate through the process was the main goal of app design.
process2: From designing potential user steps, error states, the app was tested with select users to identify potential user experience issues.
text2: Testing with users along the way also helped in identifying pain and friction points. Constant iteration and prototyping helped build the task flows.

heading3: Effective shopping and <br>cooking experience
subHeading3: As the app's audience were nuclear families, college students with roommates, the need for the members of the household to have an equal say was vital. To address the problem, members can decide on favourite recipes for the day, vote for the best recipe and the person responsible for cooking that day (Of course, you take turns and we will send reminders!) will be able to add ingredients to the cart.
process3: As it automatically generates a shopping list, on the way back from work/school, groceries can be picked up or wait for it... order it from instacart.
text3: With integrated shopping experience, the app's strategy can be used by grocery stores to customize the experiences for their users. With digital refridgerators, the shopping list can also be shared on a digital screen.
