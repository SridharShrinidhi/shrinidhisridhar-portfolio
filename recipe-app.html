heading1: Recipe app
subHeading1: The app designed created based on weekend conversations with friends, is an effective meal-planning app for single/nuclear families, homes with roommates to make for easy, simple cooking.
process1: The app features AR scanning of ingredients, to generate recipes based on selected diets/cuisines. People living with roommates can regularly create schedules to take turns at cooking. Voting amongst them helps with identifying the meal of the day. The app also features automatic grocery list creation based on the meal plans and recipes. This also helps with reducing waste by buying groceries required for the week and ensuring they don’t go to waste. Recipes are also suggested based on the expiry dates of products to ensure zero/negligible waste. Oh, I almost forgot, the app can be used by grocery stores to provide customized groceries to the consumers for a convenient shopping experience. (Please sponsor us!)
