title: Influenza app Â· Portfolio
meta: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired
heading1: Influenza App - Process
subHeading1: An app designed to help influencers, bloggers use as a marketing platform and for beauty consumers to review products. It was designed to create a sense of community for fellow beauty bloggers and to encourage people to become influencers themselves. It was initially designed for a hackathon, but picked up from before the submission.
process1: Working on this project with 2 App developers, Devesh Shetty (Android) and Abhinandan Ramaprasath(iOS), helped gain experience working with developers, understand collaboration, exporting assets and the importance of team work (Teamwork FTW!).
text1: The app features product scanner to get instant review while shopping. It also provides price comparison and shop online. Consumers in need of reviews can contact influencers on the platform asking to review products and create tutorials for the same.  Brands can also understand their user base and use the app for discounts and drop-shipping to create an engaging consumer base.
