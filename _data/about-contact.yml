- title: About me
  text1: Something about me? Let's see..<br>
        I have always loved learning new things and am very curious about new products, ideas, people, their minds. Designing user experiences in the digital world helps me understand and solve amazing problems. A perfect example of the experimental and curious side of me is this website. I have always found the process and reason behind a product more intriguing. Let's keep learning and grow together! <br>I also would like to tell you that I took a small detour, before I got to where I am, doing what I love, as an Engineer. <br>Ask me about my logo when we meet.
