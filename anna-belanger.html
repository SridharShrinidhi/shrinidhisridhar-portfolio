subHeading2: The brief for the project was to develop a clean, user friendly website that conveys the brand's message. Warm, accessible environment for clients, was the main goal of the redesign. Bearing in mind their physical spaces in Ottawa, the vibe of the space, representing the same environment on the digital website was of utmost importance. Implementing colors seen in the interior design of the spaces as the accent colours, helped complete and enhance the brand experience.
process2: The redesign provided a modern, fresh look to the website while keeping certain elements from the previous site, to help clients embrace the new design with familiarity. This was important as the target audience were regular clientele, who have been with the brand for a long time.

heading4: Design & Development
subHeading4: The website design involved multiple stages of ideating and prototyping, based on client feedback and user needs/goals. Web design prototypes for responsive screens was done using Sketch, which was a great learning experience to learn and work with the Sketch software. The client was already on the Shopify platform, and molding the theme to suit the client's needs was an incredible learning experience. It helped understand the Liquid templating language and provided an opportunity to learn the language. As Shopify themes were geared towards the product industry, modifying it to fit the services industry was an extremely rewarding opportunity.
