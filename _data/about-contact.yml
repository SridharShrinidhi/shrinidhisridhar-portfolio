- title: About me
  text1: Something about me? Let's see..<br>
        I have always loved learning new things and am very curious about new products, ideas, people, their minds. I have always found the process and reason behind a product, user behaviour/action more intriguing, and my design process is always research driven, experimental and strategy focused. A perfect example of the experimental and curious side of me is this website. Designing and improving user experiences helps me understand and solve amazing problems. <br>I also would like to tell you that I took a small detour, before I got to where I am, doing what I love, as an Engineer.
