meta: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired
heading1: Influenza app
subHeading1: An app designed to help influencers, bloggers use as a marketing platform and for beauty consumers to review products. It was designed to create a sense of community for fellow beauty bloggers and to encourage people to become influencers themselves. It was initially designed for a hackathon, but picked up from before the submission.
process1: Working on this project with 2 App developers, Devesh Shetty (Android) and Abhinandan Ramaprasath(iOS), helped gain experience working with developers, understand collaboration, exporting assets and the importance of team work (Teamwork FTW!).
text1: The app features product scanner to get instant review while shopping. It also provides price comparison and shop online. Consumers in need of reviews can contact influencers on the platform asking to review products and create tutorials for the same.  Brands can also understand their user base and use the app for discounts and drop-shipping to create an engaging consumer base.

subHeading2: The target audience for this app would be beauty consumers, influencers both micro and macro. This app was also designed to encourage users to become influencers. This helps in developing a entrepreneurial community and a platform for like-minded individuals to network.
process2: Following initial research, the competitors were identified. Quick online surveys to understand the demographic, their opinions, was sent out and helped establish needs and concerns. It also helped validate certain facts that we stumbled upon during initial research.
text2: The app design involved design for both Android and iOS users. Understanding and designing both Material Design Guidelines and Human Interface guideline, helped understand more in-depth about OS. Understanding and observing the different gestures used in the OS helped manipulate the design to provide for a friction-free prototype and elevated user experience.

heading3: AR feature
subHeading3: As the app helped the user with instant reviews, prices, price comparison, AR technology proved useful. When the user scans the barcode on the product, the reviews of the product, pulled from different sources can be accessed. Scanning the label would also produce similar results.
process3: Trying and buying new products at the retail store can be a difficult experience, to test out new products we may/may not react to. This app helps provide instantaneous reviews from other blogs and platforms. It also encourages the user to write reviews.
text3: In the absence of reviews, one can request a fellow influencer on the platform to review the product. This is a startegic way for influencers to understand their demographic and geenerate content for their consumers.
