meta: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired
heading1: Scrub Inspired - Rebrand
subHeading1: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired. The project was part of a school assignment, that involved rebranding a local entrepreneur. With the help of warm, generous client, a.k.a Scrub Inspired business owner, working on the project was an incredible learning experience.
process1: Creating complete brand guidelines for the brand, from marketing collateral to digital website. Following thorough research on the brand’s market, it’s target audience, competitors, designing a logo and brand to represent the brand’s values was a thrilling experience(slightly nerve-wracking too! My first time taking on a rebrand).

heading2: Logo
subHeading2: The logo for the brand was created to reflect a fun, eco-friendly, fresh experience for its users. The top half of the logo, the leaf, is reflective of the eco-friendly characteristic of the brand. It is also symbolic of the natural ingredients sourced for the making of the products.
process2: The lower half of the logo, is part of an oil drop an essential ingredient in their products. The colours are purely based on the colour of the oils used in their products. Using a simple font to the icon enhances the aesthetic of the logo, in keeping with the brand.

subHeading3: Along with logo, packaging design for the brand was also created. Using components from the logo with effective use of colours, a fun, functional label and packaging design was created. Gift card, gift wrapper and bags for a future brick and mortar store was designed.
process3: If a physical retail loacation were to open up, or for pop-up events, design of the physical space to represent the brand was suggested.
