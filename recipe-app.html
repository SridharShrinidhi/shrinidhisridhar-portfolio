subHeading1: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired. <br>The project was part of a school assignment, that involved rebranding a local entrepreneur. With the help of warm, generous client, a.k.a Scrub Inspired business owner, working on the project was an incredible learning experience.
process1: Creating complete brand guidelines for the brand, from marketing collateral to digital website. Following thorough research on the brand’s market, it’s target audience, competitors, designing a logo and brand to represent the brand’s values was a thrilling experience(slightly nerve-wracking too! My first time taking on a rebrand).
