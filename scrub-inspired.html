meta: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired
heading1: Scrub Inspired - Rebrand
subHeading1: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired. The project was part of a school assignment, that involved rebranding a local entrepreneur. With the help of a warm, generous client, a.k.a Scrub Inspired business owner, working on the project was an incredible learning experience.
process1: Creating complete brand guidelines for the brand, from marketing collateral to digital website. Following thorough research on the brand’s market, it’s target audience, competitors, designing a logo and brand to represent the brand’s values was a thrilling experience (slightly nerve-wracking too! My first time taking on a rebrand).
text1: The logo for the brand was created to reflect a fun, eco-friendly, fresh experience for its users.

process2: The top half of the logo, the leaf, is reflective of the eco-friendly characteristic of the brand. It is also symbolic of the natural ingredients sourced for the making of the products.
text2: The lower half of the logo, is part of an oil drop an essential ingredient in their products. The colours are purely based on the colour of the oils used in their products. Using a simple font to the icon enhances the aesthetic of the logo, in keeping with the brand.

heading4: Digital branding
subHeading4: The brand operated purely through online orders(at the time of rebrand, not anymore). To provide a clean and easy shopping experience, a responsive website design was created.

Branding and digital marketing collateral for the brand was highlighted to enhance sales and help grow the brand. As the target audience was predominantly females (#bossbabes), creating a refreshing branding was essential to the product's success.
