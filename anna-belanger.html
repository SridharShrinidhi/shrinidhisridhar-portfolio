heading1: Anna Bélanger & Associates -<br> Website redesign
subHeading1: A client project that helped me work on Shopify Themes, and work on web design and dev skills. Having experienced Anna Belanger and Associates services first-hand and meeting the warm and ever-enthusiastic #bosswoman, Anna,  behind the brand helped with understanding and creating a website for them.
process1: Redesigning the website to make it a representation of their brand, a symbol of fertility, warmth and relaxation. Working on Shopify theme (they were already part of the Shopify family), manipulating the theme’s code by understanding Liquid, their open sourced templating language, learning on the job, to create a wholesome experience, proved to be a wonderful learning experience.

subHeading2: The e-commerce pattern library we worked helped create a modular, accessible pattern library. Complete design and development of a pattern library helped understand the effectiveness of modular code. To further extend the pattern library, creating different themes will further improve the project.
process2: An app for e-commerce platform users to allow for an easy and convenient retail experience, will be part of the project. This project helps showcase my web design, mobile app design and complete digital branding.
