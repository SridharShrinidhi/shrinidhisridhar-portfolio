  text: Something about me? Let's see..
        I have always loved learning new things and it keeps me going. Very curious about new products, ideas, people, their minds, and designing user experiences, currently in the digital world, helps me understand and solve amazing problems. So if we do meet in real life and I ask too many questions, it's just because I enjoy knowing and understanding you, people in general. Oh, just before I stop typing this document, I want to tell you that I took a small detour, before I got to where I am, doing what I love, as a Electrical & Electronics Engineer.
