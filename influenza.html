title: Influenza app Â· Portfolio
meta: A rebrand project, for a skincare brand, Scrub Inspired
heading1: Influenza app
subHeading1: An app designed to help influencers, bloggers use as a marketing platform and for beauty consumers to review products. It was designed to create a sense of community for fellow beauty bloggers and to encourage people to become influencers themselves. It was initially designed for a hackathon, but picked up from before the submission.
process1: Working on this project with 2 App developers, Devesh Shetty (Android) and Abhinandan Ramaprasath(iOS), helped gain experience working with developers, understand collaboration, exporting assets and the importance of team work (Teamwork FTW!).
text1: The app features product scanner to get instant review while shopping. It also provides price comparison and shop online. Consumers in need of reviews can contact influencers on the platform asking to review products and create tutorials for the same.  Brands can also understand their user base and use the app for discounts and drop-shipping to create an engaging consumer base.

heading2: Scrub Inspired - Rebrand
subHeading2: The target audience was identified to be millenials, nuclear families, buddies rooming. Following target audience identification and research on competitors, ideation was the next step. Clean, bold app with an appealing aesthetic that helps users navigate through the process was the main goal of app design.
process2: From designing potential user steps, error states, the app was tested with select users to identify potential user experience issues.

heading3: AR app
heading3: Effective shopping and cooking experience
subHeading3: As the app's audience were nuclear families, college students with roommates, the need for the members of the household to have an equal say was vital. To address the problem, members can decide on favourite recipes for the day, vote for the best recipe and the person responsible for cooking that day (Ofcourse, you take turns and we will send reminders!) will be able to add ingredients to the cart. As it automatically generates a shopping list, on the way back from work/school, groceries can be picked up or wait for it... order it from instacart.
process3: With integrated shopping experience, the app's strategy can be used by grocery stores to customize the experiences for their users. With digital refridgerators, the shopping list can also be shared on a digital screen.

heading4: Process
subHeading4: The brand operated purely through online orders(at the time of rebrand, not anymore). To provide a clean and easy shopping experience, a responsive website was created.
process4: Branding and digital marketing collateral for the brand was highlighted to enhance sales and help grow the brand. As the target audience was predominantely females(#bossbabes), creating a refreshing branding was essential to the product's success.
